# ReviveForge â€“ Our Story, Tech, and Launch!

Hey Indie Hackers ðŸ‘‹

Weâ€™re launching ReviveForge, a marketplace for abandoned SaaS and digital projects. Why? Because weâ€™ve all had side projects gather dust, and we know thereâ€™s value left in those codebases.

**Backstory:**
We started ReviveForge after struggling to find a good home for our own abandoned apps. Listing, pricing, and transferring ownership was always a pain. We wanted a better way.

**Tech stack:** Next.js 14, Supabase, Stripe, OpenAI, Resend, Sentry.

**MRR goal:** $2k/mo by end of year. Weâ€™re bootstrapped and focused on real users.

**Ask:**
- What would make you trust a marketplace for abandoned projects?
- Whatâ€™s your biggest fear buying/selling?
- Would you use AI valuation or onboarding tools?

Feedback and questions welcome! ðŸš€
